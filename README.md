# Multiplee-Camaras-Checking
To check the multiple cameras working or not.
1. In Deep Learning we use multiple cameras to access feed.
2. Before accessing the feed from the RTSP cameras, we can check if they are working or not.
3. I used 2 cameras rtsp ip address to check however we can use any number of cameras to check.
